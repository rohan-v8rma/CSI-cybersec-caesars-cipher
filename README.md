# Decrypting Caesar's Cipher

This project uses brute force method to find all possibilities of the decoded text using the encoded string provided as input.

## Stegnography

Stegnography is the technique of hiding a file or a message within another file.

I used the `strings` tool as demonstrated in the executable shell script `strings.sh`, in order to find the flag similar to the format: 
```
CSI{XXXX_XXXX} 
```
`strings` displays all the printable strings present in a given file. <br>
This tool is available by default in linux and requires no installation.
